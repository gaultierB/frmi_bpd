Participants
Twenty people with borderline personality disorder were recruited from outpatient and support 
services from around Edinburgh, Scotland. Diagnoses were confirmed using the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-II). Current symptoms were assessed using the Zanarini Rating Scale 
for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD [1]). Adverse childhood events were assessed using 
the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ [2]). Fifteen BPD participants were receiving antidepressant 
medication and twelve were taking antipsychotic medication. Twenty age- and sex-matched controls 
were recruited from the community, however four were excluded due to technical issues during 
scanning, leaving sixteen controls. Exclusion criteria for all participants included pregnancy, 
MRI contraindications, diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, previous head injury or current 
illicit substance dependence. Controls met the additional criteria of no personal or familial 
history of major mental illness. Ethical approval was obtained from the Lothian National 
Health Service Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed 
consent before taking part. 

Experimental task
Participants performed the Cyberball social exclusion task [3] during functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI), adapted from a previous implementation by Kumar et al 2009 [4]. 
The task involves playing “catch” with two computer-controlled players, during which the 
participant can be systematically included or excluded from the game.  We used this task as 
it assesses neural responses to social exclusion, is known to activate a range of social 
brain regions [5] and is amenable to reinforcement learning modelling [4]. The task was 
modified such that inclusion was varied parametrically over four levels: 0%, 33%, 66% and 
100%, achieved by arranging the task into blocks of nine throws, respectively involving zero, 
one, two or three throws to the participant. Here, 100% inclusion means the degree to which 
the participant was included was equal to that of the other two players, with each receiving 
three throws per nine-throw block. Participants were asked to imagine that the other players 
were real, as exclusion by both human or simulated players has been previously reported to 
be similarly distressing [6-8]. When the participant received the ball, they indicated which 
computer player they wished to throw the ball to with a button press. There were four 
repetitions of each inclusion level, providing 16 experimental blocks in total, with the 
first block being 100% inclusion, and all subsequent blocks being randomised. Each throwing 
event had a mean duration of 2700ms, with each being preceded by randomised jitter that was 
in part adjusted to accommodate the participant’s reaction time from the previous trial, 
when applicable. This was achieved by comparing the total duration of the previous trial, 
including reaction time, with the ideal trial time of 2700ms: if this value was exceeded, 
a random jitter between 0 and 1000ms was subtracted from the mean jitter time of 1500ms; 
otherwise, the random jitter was added to 1500ms. Jitter therefore varied between 500ms and 
2500ms. Mean block duration was 24s, with onsets denoted by the appearance of the cartoon 
figures following rest, and offsets by the conclusion of the final throw animation. Blocks 
were randomized, and interleaved with 13s rest blocks. Within blocks, throwing events were 
jittered to permit event disambiguation for reinforcement learning analysis. 

Neuroimaging
Scanning took place at the Clinical Research Imaging Centre in Edinburgh, using a 3T Siemens 
Magnetom Verio scanner. Echo Planar Blood Oxygen Level Dependent images were acquired axially 
with a TR 1560ms, TE 26ms, flip angle 66’, field of view 220 x 220mm, in-plane resolution 
64 x 64, 26 interleaved slices, 347 volumes, resolution 3.4 x 3.4 x 5mm. A high resolution 
T1 MPRAGE structural image was acquired with TR 2300ms, TE 2.98ms, flip angle 90’, field of 
view 256 x 256mm, in-plane resolution 256 x 256, 160 interleaved slices, resolution 1 x 1 x 1mm.
